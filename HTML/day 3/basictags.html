        <h1>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h1>
        <p>
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are!
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
<br>
When the blazing sun is gone,<br>
When he nothing shines upon,<br>
Then you show your little light,<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.<br>
<br>
Then the trav'ller in the dark,<br>
Thanks you for your tiny spark,<br>
He could not see which way to go,<br>
If you did not twinkle so.<br>
<br>
In the dark blue sky you keep,<br>
And often thro' my curtains peep,<br>
For you never shut your eye,<br>
Till the sun is in the sky.<br>

'Tis your bright and tiny spark,<br>
Lights the trav'ller in the dark:<br>
Tho' I know not what you are,<br>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.<br>
